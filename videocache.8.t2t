== Name and Description ==

Videocache (http://cachevideos.com/) - A Squid url rewriter plugin to cache dynamic audio/video content from different video portals/websites.

Videocache is a Squid url rewriter plugin written in Python to facilitate caching youtube, facebook, metacafe, dailymotion, vimeo, cnn, aol, myspace, bing, blip.tv, break, wrzuta.pl, xhamster, xvideos, pornhub, spankwire, hardsextube, keezmovies, slutload, extremetube, redtube, xtube, youporn and tube8 videos. It can cache videos from various websites in a separate directory (other than Squid cache), in a browsable fashion and can serve the subsequent requests from the cache. It helps in saving bandwidth and reducing load time of the videos. Videocache is currently used by a number of ISPs in various parts of the world.

**NOTE** : If you are new to Squid or you are willing to explore Squid in details, please check my new book **Squid Proxy Server 3.1: Beginner's Guide** at http://tinyurl.com/squidbook.

== Dependencies ==
+ Squid >= 2.6
+ python >= 2.4
+ python-iniparse
+ Apache or any other Web Server


== Installation & Configuration ==
See INSTALL file in Videocache source or visit http://cachevideos.com/installation for installation instructions.

== Squid Configuration ==
Add the following lines to your squid.conf which is generally located at ///etc/squid/squid.conf//
```
# --BEGIN-- videocache config for squid
copy_to_squid.conf
# --END-- videocache config for squid
```

Save squid.conf and reload the squid service using the following command
```
[root@proxy root]# /etc/init.d/squid reload
```

== Running or Updating Videocache ==

If you update your Videocache configuration file located at ///etc/videocache.conf// or you just finished installing Videocache, then you need to perform the following four steps. These steps are mandatory and Videocache will not work properly unless you perform these steps.

=== 1. Update Script (vc-update) ===

**NOTE** : Please check http://cachevideos.com/vc-update for latest documentation.

Once you are done updating the Videocache configuration file and ready to deploy the new options, you should, first of all, run the update script (vc-update) which will update your cache directories, Apache configuration file and other system file accordingly. You can run this command as follows
```
[root@proxy root]# vc-update
```
To know the available options, please use the following command
```
[root@proxy root]# vc-update -h
```

=== 2. Videocache Scheduler ===

**NOTE** : Please check http://cachevideos.com/vc-scheduler for latest documenation.

Make sure that the Videocache scheduler (vc-scheduler) is running. Restart vc-scheduler using the following command
```
[root@proxy root]# vc-scheduler -s restart
```
To see the list of options availbale, please use the following command
```
[root@proxy root]# vc-scheduler -h
```

=== 3. Apache Web Server ===

Restart the Apache web server using the following command
```
[root@proxy root]# apachectl -k restart
```

=== 4. Squid Proxy Server ===

Once all the above steps have succeeded, you need to reload or restart your proxy server daemon which will run Videocache with the updating configuration.

To reload Squid proxy server, use the following command 
```
[root@proxy root]# /etc/init.d/squid reload
```
Or to restart Squid proxy server, use the following command
```
[root@proxy root]# /etc/init.d/squid restart
```

== Videocache Global Configuration ==

Below is a description of various options you can use to configure Videocache. A description of these options is also available at http://cachevideos.com/configure.

Config file : /etc/videocache.conf

: **enable_videocache**
This option controls the global behavior of Videocache plugin. If it is 0, Videocache will stop caching or serving anything. This option's value can be either 0 or 1. Default: 1.

: **client_email**
Please set this option to the email address using which you purchased Videocache license.

**IMPORTANT** : This must be set appropriately otherwise Videocache will not work.

: **offline_mode**
When Offline Mode is enabled, Videocache will serve the videos already in cache and will skip caching the new videos. When set to 0, Videocache will cache new video and when set to 1, Videocache will serve the already cached videos and will not cache the new videos is encounters. Default: 0.

: **videocache_user**
Use this option to set the user which should be running Videocache scheduler. This user must be same as the Squid user. On RedHat/CentOS/SuSE, it's generally //squid// and on Debian/Ubuntu/BSDs, it generally //proxy//. Default: //squid//.

**IMPORTANT** : This must be set appropriately otherwise Videocache will not work.

: **cache_host**
The hostname or IP address of the system on which caching is being done. This is used for serving the videos from the cache.

**IMPORTANT** : Please donâ€™t use http:// or slashes (/). Just specify the domain name or IP address.
Additionally you can select an alternative port to use.
```
Example : proxy.example.com
or 192.168.36.204
or 192.168.36.204:81
or <Proxy_Server_IP_OR_Domain:HTTP_PORT>
```
Default: 127.0.0.1.

: **base_dir**
Base directories for caching the videos. You can specify multiple caching directories here separated by '|' symbol. Please try to avoid special characters in directory names like spaces, $ etc.
``` Example : base_dir = /var/spool/videocache/ | /videocache2/stuff-new/|/new_videocache.
Default: ///var/spool/videocache///.

: **max_cache_processes**
The maximum number of parallel cache processes allowed. If all connections are consumed, videos will be queued for caching. Default: 10.

: **max_cache_speed**
The maximum bandwidth allocated to a cache process. For example, when //max_cache_speed// is set to 100, a cache process can cache a video at a maximum speed of 100 kilobytes per second. Set this to zero (0) if you want a cache process to use unlimited bandwidth.
``` Example: max_cache_speed = 100 (Please don't append KB or MB).
Default: 0

**IMPORTANT** : The maximum bandwidth used by Videocache at any time can not exceed //max_cache_processes// x //max_cache_speed// kilobytes per second. So, you can configure these options depending on bandwidth availability.

: **proxy**
**Warning** : __**USE THIS ONLY IF**__ Videocache Server should go via anohter proxy.

Proxy for http content. Default: <blank>.
```
Example : http_proxy = http://<Proxy_Server_IP_OR_Domain>:<Proxy_port>/
or http://proxy.example.com:3128/
```

: **proxy_username**
If the above proxy requires authentication, please specify the username. Default: <blank>.

: **proxy_password**
If the above proxy requires authentication, please specify the password. Default: <blank>.

: **hit_threshold**
No of times a video should be requested before we start caching it. Default: 1

: **max_video_size**
The video of size more than //max_video_size// (MegaBytes) will not be cached. Default: 0.
``` EXAMPLE: If max_video_size = 50, Videocache will not cache videos of size more than 50MB.  Set this to 0 to disable this check. Don't append MB.

: **min_video_size**
The video of size less than //min_video_size// (MegaBytes) will not be cached. Default: 0.
``` EXAMPLE: If min_video_size = 2, Videocache will not cache videos of size less than 2MB.  Set this to 0 to disable this check. Don't append MB.

: **disk_avail_threshold**
This option sets the minimum available free space in Mega Bytes that is left in a partition containing a cache directory before Videocache treats that partition as FULL. Default: 1000.
``` EXAMPLE: If disk_avail_threshold = 200, Videocache will stop caching videos in a cache directory if the free space available in that cache directory is less than 200 Mega Bytes.

: **enable_videocache_cleaner**
Enables the Videocache cleaner script which will remove videos from cache which have not been used since long. The value of this option can be 0 or 1. Default: 1.

: **video_lifetime**
The maximum life of a video in cache without being used. If the video was not accessed for more than //video_lifetime// days, it'll be removed from the cache. The unit of video_lifetime is days. Default: 30.
``` Example : video_lifetime = 15 will remove videos which were not used since last 15 or more days.

: **logformat, scheduler_logformat, cleaner_logformat**
Logformat allows you to get log messages in your preferred format. The //logformat//, //scheduler_logformat//, //cleaner_logformat// are applicable to main Videocache log, scheduler log and cleaner log respectively. Use the format codes described below.

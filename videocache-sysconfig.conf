#
# %  - A literal % character
# ts - Seconds since epoch
# tu - Time in millisecond
# tl - Local Time
# tg - GMT Time
# p  - Process ID of the process logging the message
# s  - Severity level of the log message
# i  - Client's IP address
# w  - Website ID (eg. YOUTUBE/GOOGLE/VIMEO etc.)
# c  - Status Code (CACHE_HIT/CACHE_MISS etc.)
# v  - Video ID of current video
# b  - Size of the video in bytes
# m  - Additional Message (for verbose logs)
# d  - Debug message (for debugging purpose)
#
# Examples:
# logformat = %ts %i %w %c %v

# You can use a custom format for displaying time in log messages.
# Use the format codes described below
# %a    Abbreviated weekday name (Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat)
# %A    Full weekday name (Sunday, Monday, ...)
# %b    Abbreviated month name (Jan, Feb, Mar, ...)
# %B    Full month name (January, February, ...)
# %d    Day of the month as a decimal number [01..31]
# %H    Hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00..23]
# %I    Hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01..12]
# %j    Day of the year as a decimal number [001..366]
# %m    Month as a decimal number [01..12]
# %M    Minute as a decimal number [00..59]
# %p    Either AM or PM

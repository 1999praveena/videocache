     You can use the setup.py install script to explore advanced installation options.

     Use the -h option to get a list of options available.

  BINGO!! You are done with installation. In case you get any error while installing
  videocache, there will be proper logging in the console.

3. Configuration
================
  Assuming you have squid installed. The following configurations are required
  to get videocache running. Users new to Squid are instructed to stick with default
  configuration as much as possible otherwise you'll may face unexpected problems.

  a) Restart the httpd service as
    [root@videocache root]# apachectl -k restart

  b) Start/restart videocache scheduler (vc-scheduler) using the following command
    [root@videocache root]# vc-scheduler -s restart

    Use the following command to see available options
    [root@videocache root]# vc-scheduler -h

  c) Depending on your version of Squid, open the file vc_squid_x.conf shipped with the
     software bundle and copy the contents to your Squid configuration file generally
     located at /etc/squid/squid.conf.

     For Squid version 2.x, use the file vc_squid_2.conf and for Squid version 3.x, use
     the file vc_squid_3.conf.

     Save squid.conf and reload/restart the squid service using
     [root@proxy root]# /etc/init.d/squid restart

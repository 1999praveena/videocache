    Assuming you have installed squid. The following configurations are required
    to get videocache running. Users new to Squid are instructed to stick with default

    Depending on your version of Squid, open the file vc_squid_x.conf shipped with the
    software bundle and copy the contents to your Squid configuration file generally
    located at /etc/squid/squid.conf. Please paste the contents at the top of your

    the file vc_squid_3.conf.

  See Readme.txt file or videocache manpage for more configuration options.
